`.deeployignore` config
=======================

`.deeployignore` configuration file is used to ignore certain resources to be deployed.
Currently only lambda resources can be ignored.
It has to be located in the property root directory, on same same level with [`deeploy.json`](https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework/blob/master/docs/tools/deploy.md).

### Example:

Ignore deploying all `deep-stripe` lambda resources, except `deep-stripe:payment:create` and `deep-stripe:payment:execute`

```ignore
resource/deep-stripe:*:*
!resource/deep-stripe:payment:create
!resource/deep-stripe:payment:execute
```
> `.deeployignore` is using similar syntax to `.ignore` standard
